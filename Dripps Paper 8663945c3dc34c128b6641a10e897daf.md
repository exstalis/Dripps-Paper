# Dripps Paper

*Research findings have begun to highlight how interactions with ICTs, including social*
*media, are correlated with positive (e.g. gains in social capital, reduced depression) and*
*negative (e.g. physical isolation, social comparison, envy) aspects of physical, mental, and*
*spiritual well-being (Choi and DiNitto, 2013; Pearce and Rice, 2013; Appel, Gerlach & Crusius,*
*2016; Shakya & Christakis, 2017).* 

```nasm
Does this research psychological value between positive and negative out comes of digital social interactions ? So to speak, do we know which one weigh in more in consideration with well being of the society
```

However, there has been less theory developed to date about
how interactions with specific digital places influence well-being in the context of interactions
with physical places.

```nasm
that answers to the previous question on my notes
```

In expanding our understanding of how digital places influence well-being, we might also
look to sociological approaches, which have elaborated on how place effects in physical settings
operate in part through their design (think: built characteristics), which can encourage or
discourage social interaction, and thereby increase or decrease potential social influence
(Logan, 2012).

```nasm
drive from this, we can say that ICTs systems, like Dripps, can support improvement in relationships between places and physical set up , hence, help us to tackle negative outcomes arisen in socio-psychology and drive the future of connections through collective sociological positive outcomes.
```

According to sociologists, the design of places can influence well-being in a variety
of ways, including by embodying and entrenching otherwise intangible cultural norms, identities
and memories that facilitate social structural patterns (e.g., categories, differences and
hierarchies); and by arranging chance face-to-face interactions (e.g., through the design of
staircases at places of work), thus shaping the formation of social networks and, potentially,
stronger or weaker communities *(Gieryn, 2000).*

```nasm
refer to most physical structure design to a digital social structure
```

Geosocial data encompasses a variety of media
forms (e.g. photographs shared via Instagram, Twitter posts, etc.) but fundamentally include
some aspect of an online social media contribution from an individual user and a location
associated with it. Studies that examine spatial patterns in geosocial data usually make the
implicit assumption that what people post in their social media is partly a reflection of their
experience in physical place-time; for example, imbuing the locational expression of these posts
with some place-based meaning (Hauthal and Burghardt, 2016). To our knowledge, there is little
or no research that supports this assumption.

```nasm
can this assumption suggest that we manifest our life experiences; communicating by using the data we collected and constructed to project ? 

If there is a implicit assumption, can there be also implicit correlation to the places we design also impacts to how we project ? 

Can more transparency and clearness in a secure physical set up can establish more positive projections on digital social platform?

```nasm
Can location data clusters aim to secure more individuals?
Web3 cultures embraces diversity in locations ( either for individuals or groups of peoples) -> can designing with a web3 philosophy help us to solve discrepancies between cultural strata and multi-hierarchical social communications?
```

Similar approaches by
Huang et al. (2017) and Robertson et al (2017) use space-time clustering and activity-based
models of human movement to derive individual places. These types of individual-based models
of place using geosocial data can reflect the range of groups and geographic activity patterns
within a population of social media contributors better than aggregate approaches where these
differences are often masked.

can dripps provide both jaiku's nested structure as well as twitters location, within a secure scope, pillars?
```

*Erickson (2010) argued that Twitter’s design encouraged more straightforward broadcasting,*
*sometimes about specific places, which facilitated communal bonds more reflective of a*
*“common geographical territory” (p.1204); whereas the social media Jaiku was better structured*
*to facilitate threaded conversations that relied less on location. Davenport and colleagues*
*(2013) observed differences in how younger and older narcissists preferred using Twitter and*

*In one case, a study might aim to investigate the physical or social environment of social media use in*
*a direct and momentary way by linking expressions to GPS coordinates. Here, interaction in the*
*physical place are of primary interest, while digital place interactions may be less important for*
*examining well-being.*

Here, GPS coordinates can help indicate whether expressions are related to direct
or indirect (e.g., future, past, never) experiences, and therefore, the utility of data about physical
places.

NFT metadata as locationfuture past and never experience.
```

*This active identity construction carries over to geosocial data as well, through*
*the selection of which places warrant posting and/or checking in on geographically referenced*
*social media networks. Schwartz and Halegoua (2015) describe this selection through the*
*framework of the spatial self, which examines the presentation of one’s identity through*
*geographic traces of physical (i.e., real world) activity. As described by Saker (2017) the spatial*
*self ‘involves people actively thinking about the spaces they frequent, what they might present*
*about their identity, and if this fits in with their on-going narratives.’*

```nasm
Spatial Identity: If we enlarge the geosocial data, does it improve spatial self -> make the spatial-identity more flexible and adaptable? Can this also effect the perception of others?
